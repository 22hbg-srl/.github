# 22HBG Community Guidelines

At 22HBG, we recognize and celebrate the creativity and collaboration of open source contributors and the diversity of skills, experiences, cultures, and opinions they bring to the projects and communities they participate in.

We value diverse opinions, but always remember to be kind, constructive, and helpful.

Some of our projects may adopt an explicit project code of conduct, which may have additional detailed expectations for participants.

## Reporting problems

Always report problems relative to a project to the employee identified as Project Steward of that project. If you want to report a problem regarding multiple projects write a few lines to [info@22hbg.com](mailto:info@22hbg.com)
